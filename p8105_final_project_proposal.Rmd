## The tentative project title


## The motivation for this project
We want to understand more about the trends in COVID-19 cases by state and by month. As we move into colder months, we also want to see if there is an association between COVID-19 cases and climate.

## The intended final products
Our intended final products will be a website with a dashboard, along with a report stating our findings. Our dashboard will contain summary visualizations. We will also do an interactive map for statewide data. The website will include a screencast walking our audience through the process that we took to complete the project. 

## The anticipated data sources

We are planning to use the CDC dataset for the statewide daily COVID-19 cases, and to pull the climate data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) for all 50 states from the NOAA website.
